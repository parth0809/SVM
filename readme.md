# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model using Python to perform supervised machine learning classification tasks. The notebook walks through the entire ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

##  Overview

The notebook `25CS60R35_SVM.ipynb` covers:
- Loading and exploring a dataset
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, and feature selection)
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training an SVM classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizing decision boundaries and results
